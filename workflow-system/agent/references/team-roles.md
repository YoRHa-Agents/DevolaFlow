# Team Roles Reference

## 1. Team Relationship to Layers
From §4.0:

```
Layer 0 (Project)  ── workflow-type-agnostic orchestrator
Layer 1 (Stage)    ── stage-type-agnostic orchestrator
Layer 2 (Wave)     ── parallel-dispatch coordinator
Layer 3 (Task)     ── AgentTeam member (one of 5 roles)
                       ├── Research Agent
                       ├── Design Agent
                       ├── Implement Agent
                       ├── Test Agent
                       └── Review Agent
```

Teams are role classifications for Layer 3 Task Agents. The task's `type`
field in TaskDispatch determines which team role template configures the agent.

## 2. Research Team
From §4.1:

**Role:** Gather, analyze, and synthesize information. Establishes the
knowledge foundation that downstream teams build upon.

### Standard Workflow

```

2. GATHER     — Search web, read docs, scan codebases, fetch references
3. ANALYZE    — Compare findings against criteria; build comparison matrices
4. SYNTHESIZE — Produce structured report with recommendations + confidence
5. SELF-CHECK — Verify all criteria addressed; flag gaps
```

### Input Contract

```yaml

### Standard Workflow

```
1. ORIENT       — Read task spec, identify test scope, review acceptance criteria
2. SETUP        — Verify test infrastructure, install deps, prepare test data

## 6. Review Team
From §4.5:

**Role:** Evaluate artifacts against quality standards. NEVER modifies
artifacts — produces findings that other teams act on.

### Standard Workflow

```
1. ORIENT      — Read task spec, identify review scope, load checklist
2. LOAD_RULES  — Load code-rules for target language and quality dimensions
3. STRUCTURAL  — Review architecture: modules, dependencies, interfaces
4. BEHAVIORAL  — Review logic: correctness, error handling, edge cases, security
5. STYLISTIC   — Review conventions: naming, formatting, documentation, idioms
6. SCORE       — Calculate quality score using severity-weighted formula
7. REPORT      — Produce structured review report with classified findings
```

### Input Contract

```yaml
review_task_input:
  review_type: "code | design | security | architecture | documentation"
  target_files: ["string"]
  design_reference: "string | null"
  code_rules:
    loading_strategy: "standard | full"
    language: "string"
    quality_focus: ["string"]
  review_checklist: ["string"]
  prior_review: "string | null"
  severity_weights:
    blocker: 25
    critical: 15
    major: 5
    minor: 1
    info: 0
```

### Output Contract

```yaml
review_task_output:
  report_path: "string"
  summary: "string"                    # 2-3 sentence summary
  findings:
    - finding_id: "string"            # e.g., "F001"
      severity: "blocker | critical | major | minor | info"
      category: "correctness | security | performance | style
                | design_compliance | maintainability"
      location: "string"              # file:line or section
      description: "string"
      suggestion: "string | null"
      rule_id: "string | null"
  quality_score: "number (0-100)"
  findings_by_severity:
    blocker: "integer"
    critical: "integer"
    major: "integer"
    minor: "integer"
    info: "integer"
  verdict: "PASS | REVISE | REJECT"
  verdict_rationale: "string"
  checklist_coverage:
    items_checked: "integer"
    items_total: "integer"
```

### Quality Score Formula

```
quality_score = max(0, 100 - Σ(severity_weight × finding_count))

Severity weights: blocker=25, critical=15, major=5, minor=1, info=0
```

### Quality Criteria

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Checklist coverage | 100% items evaluated |
| Severity classification | Correctly classified (no inflation/deflation) |
| Score calculation | Uses agreed formula |
| Finding specificity | Each has specific location + actionable description |
| Verdict consistency | Consistent with score and threshold |
| Suggestions | Provided for critical and blocker findings |

### Simplicity Check

Every Review agent MUST evaluate against these scope-creep and over-engineering criteria:

| Check | FAIL if |
|-------|---------|
| Speculative features | Code adds capability not required by task objective |
| Unnecessary abstraction | Indirection/generalization without current use case |
| Line traceability | Any changed line cannot be traced to a task acceptance criterion |
| Premature optimization | Performance work without measured bottleneck evidence |
| Gold-plating | Polish beyond acceptance criteria (extra formatting, unused config) |

A finding of severity `major` is raised for each violation. This prevents scope creep at the source.

### Tools/Skills

`Read`, `Grep`, `SemanticSearch`, `ReadLints`, `Write`, code-rules protocol

## 7. Team Participation Matrix
From §4.6:

| Workflow Type | Research | Design | Implement | Test | Review |
|---------------|----------|--------|-----------|------|--------|
| research-only | **Primary** | — | — | — | — |
| design-only | — | **Primary** | — | — | Active |
| hotfix | — | — | **Primary** | Active | Minimal |
| refactoring | — | — | **Primary** | **Primary** | Optional |
| migration | Active | — | **Primary** | Active | Optional |
| spike-poc | Active | — | Active | — | — |
| documentation | Active | — | — | — | Active |
| security-audit | Active | — | Active | Active | Active |
| RDRR | **Primary** | **Primary** | — | — | **Primary** |
| full-pipeline | Active | **Primary** | **Primary** | **Primary** | **Primary** |

**Primary** = drives the stage. **Active** = participates. **—** = not involved.

## 8. Handoff Protocol
From §5:

### Handoff Deliverable Schema

```yaml
handoff_deliverable:
  metadata:
    deliverable_id: "string (UUID)"
    source_team: "research | design | implement | test | review"
    target_team: "research | design | implement | test | review"
    stage_id: "string"
    timestamp: "ISO8601"
    version: "integer"                 # increments on revision

  content:
    artifact_paths: ["string"]
    summary: "string"                  # 3-5 sentence summary
    key_decisions: ["string"]
    constraints_imposed: ["string"]
    open_items: ["string"]

  quality:
    self_assessed_score: "number"
    review_verdict: "PASS | REVISE | null"
    known_limitations: ["string"]
```

### Standard Handoff Chains

```
Research ──research_report──► Design
Design  ──design_document──► Implement
Implement ──source_code──► Review
Implement ──source_code──► Test
Review  ──review_findings──► Implement
Test    ──test_results──► Implement
```

### Handoff Contracts by Team Pair

| Source → Target | Deliverable | Required Sections | Acceptance |
|----------------|------------|-------------------|------------|
| Research → Design | Research report | findings, matrix, recommendation, gaps | All criteria addressed, confidence ≥ medium |
| Design → Implement | Design document | architecture, interfaces, models, ADRs | 100% requirements coverage, zero blocking questions |
| Implement → Review | Source + test code | all changed files | Build passes, lint clean, self-review MUST=0 |
| Implement → Test | Source + test code | files + acceptance criteria | Build passes, test scaffolding present |
| Review → Implement | Review findings | severity findings, score, verdict | All findings have severity, location, description |
| Test → Implement | Test results | pass/fail, coverage, gaps, regressions | All suites executed, coverage measured |

### Handoff Acceptance Check

```yaml
handoff_acceptance:
  checks:
    - completeness: "All required sections present (no TBD/TODO)"
    - parsability: "Well-formed, readable, no broken references"
    - scope_alignment: "Summary matches receiving team's task"
    - blocker_free: "No unresolved blocking items"
  on_pass: "Begin work"
  on_fail: "Reject with feedback → return to source team"
```

### Rejection-Remediation Cycle

1. Receiving team sends ExceptionEscalation (blocking, quality_threshold)
2. Stage Agent packages rejection with reasons + suggested fixes
3. Stage Agent reports FAIL with loop_back_target to source stage
4. Project Agent re-dispatches source stage with rejection as context
5. Source runs targeted remediation wave (not full re-execution)
6. Maximum 2 rejection-remediation cycles before human escalation
