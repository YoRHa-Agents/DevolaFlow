  Defines the `.local/.agent/` change-driven workspace tree (active changes,
  handoff envelopes, archived changes, source-of-truth specs) introduced in
  DevolaFlow v8.3.0. Covers per-artifact token budgets, lifecycle FSM, the
  Python API surface (`devolaflow.agent_workspace`), append-only handoff
  semantics (Rule S-9), file-ownership constraint (Rule S-8), the OpenSpec-
  inspired delta-spec format, and the auto-generated REPORT.md surface.
  Use this when authoring `change-driven` workflows, debugging handoffs,
  archiving completed changes, or proposing source-of-truth spec mutations.

# Agent Workspace Reference

The agent workspace is DevolaFlow's machine-parseable, lightweight,
change-scoped substrate for OpenSpec-inspired in-flight work. Every
in-flight change owns a folder under `.local/.agent/active/<change-id>/`
with strict per-artifact token budgets, escalates via append-only
handoff envelopes under `.local/.agent/handoff/`, and is preserved
verbatim in `.local/.agent/archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<change-id>/` after the
gate passes.

## 1. When to Load This Reference

Load when the task involves any of:

| Trigger | What you'll be doing |
|---------|----------------------|
| Authoring a `change-driven` workflow dispatch | Need scaffold layout + STATUS.yaml schema |
| Writing or replying to a handoff envelope | Need append-only seq rules + envelope_kind variants |
| Archiving a completed change | Need archive directory layout + REPORT.md template |
| Lint-checking artifact token budgets | Need Rule C-9 budget table + `lint_change` API |
| Proposing a delta merge into source-of-truth | Need ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED format + A-4 ADR |
| Hydrating L3 context from an active change | Need `hydrate_change_context()` API |
| Wiring shell-proxy / memory-router into a change | Cross-link to `references/shell-proxy.md` + `references/execution-protocol.md` §10/§11 |
| Composing change-driven with the convergence loop | Cross-link to `references/decomposition-gate.md` §6 + `references/execution-protocol.md` §12 |

If the task is a generic feature/bugfix that does NOT touch
`.local/.agent/`, this reference is OPTIONAL — load only when the
delegation chain explicitly opts into the `change-driven` workflow
template (registered in `templates/registry.yaml` since v8.2.6).

### When to Engage (v9.1.1+)

The SKILL.md §"Workspace Engagement (Read at Session Start)" section is
the canonical entry point: every L0 dispatcher MUST call
`devolaflow.workspace_context.scan_workspace(repo_root)` at session
start to obtain a frozen `WorkspaceContext` snapshot, then route per
the activation matrix below. The scan itself is read-only (S-2 / S-7
relative-paths-only) and ALWAYS performed; auto-write side effects are
gated by `DEVOLAFLOW_AGENT_WORKSPACE=1` per W-20 (REUSED env-flag —
no new variable per the cycle plan §"Two-axis activation").

| Workspace surface (snapshot field) | Complexity ≤ Simple | Standard | Complex |
|---|---|---|---|
| `has_local=False` AND `has_rules=False` | proceed without engagement | scaffold via `devola-init local` then re-scan | scaffold + `--with-examples` (v9.2.0+) |
| `recent_feedbacks` non-empty | optional read | READ latest 3, surface themes in plan | READ latest 3 + cite verbatim in design ADR |
| `source_of_truth_specs` non-empty | inherit as ground truth | TREAT each as A-4 contract; per-change `spec.md` writes deltas | same + `propose_merge` at archive time |
| `active_changes` non-empty | inspect `STATUS.yaml.state` | RESUME the change unless user explicitly opts out (`--no-change`) | MUST resume; opening a parallel change is a S-8 violation |
| `rules_layer_set` non-empty + `compiled_corpora` complete | trust the compiled corpus | same + opt-in `agents_md_slice` for L3 task slices | same + cite layer headings in dispatch context |

**Default-OFF auto-write contract** (R5 strict): even when
`scan_workspace` reports `has_agent_dir=True`, NO handoff envelope is
written automatically until `DEVOLAFLOW_AGENT_WORKSPACE=1`. The
v9.1.3 `pre_handoff` hook (PV-03 of this cycle) is the production
caller that flips on under the env-flag; v9.1.1 PV-01 ships the
discovery API as the prerequisite.

**Envelope policy clarification (S-9 reminder)**: every envelope under
`.local/.agent/handoff/<from>__<to>__<change-id>__<seq>.yaml` is
append-only. To convey new information, author a NEW envelope at
`seq+1`. NEVER edit or delete an existing envelope. The append-only
ledger is the contract that prevents silent overwrites between agents
operating in parallel; mirrors P5 (Artifacts as Contracts). CI enforces
immutability via `tests/test_handoff_envelope_immutable.py` (lands with
the v8.2.4 schema package).

### Path conventions

- All paths are relative to repo root (Rule S-2 / Soul invariant). Never absolute.
- **change-id** = lowercase-kebab-case (`add-dark-mode`, `fix-auth-bug`,
  `v8.3.0-pv09-skill-references-bench`). For DevolaFlow's own iteration cycles,
  use `<version>-pv<NN>-<topic>` for traceability.
- **Date prefix** for archives uses ISO-8601 `YYYY-MM-DD` (sorts chronologically).
- **Sequence numbers** for handoff envelopes are monotonic integers starting at 1,
  zero-padded to 4 digits (`0001`, `0002`, ...) for sort-correct directory listing.

## 3. Lifecycle FSM

```

### State transitions

Machine-enforced via `STATUS.yaml` `state` field:

| From | To | Trigger |
|------|----|---------|
| `PROPOSED` | `IN_PROGRESS` | First L3 dispatch starts |
| `IN_PROGRESS` | `VERIFYING` | `/devola:verify` invoked (or manual STATUS.yaml edit) |
| `VERIFYING` | `IN_PROGRESS` | Verify FAIL → bounded retry (P4) |
| `VERIFYING` | `ARCHIVED` | Verify PASS + `/devola:archive` invoked + gate PASS |
| `IN_PROGRESS` | `ESCALATED` | P4 bounded retry exhausted; human intervention required |
| `ARCHIVED` | (terminal) | No further transitions |
| `ESCALATED` | (terminal) | Human resolves out-of-band |

**Note**: Slash commands (`/devola:propose`, `/devola:apply`, `/devola:verify`,
`/devola:archive`) are deferred to v8.4.0+ per Q-3 in design.md §11.2. In v8.3.0,
the same lifecycle is driven by manual scaffolding plus `change-driven` workflow
template stages (`propose → apply → verify → archive`).

## 3.6 Resume After Pause (v10.5.0 PV-03)

Documentation only — no new code, no new schema, no new template.
This subsection answers: **what does L0 do when returning to an
active change folder ≥ 24 h later, in a new session, after the
operator has been off-task?** All machinery cited below already
exists at v10.4.0 (STATUS.yaml, append-only handoff envelopes,
change_context dispatch field). Cross-references: `STATUS.yaml`
schema §4 (this file), handoff envelope append-only S-9, W-19
cycle-archive boundary, `references/execution-protocol.md` §2
checkpoint mechanism.

### Pre-resume checklist (5 steps)

L0 MUST execute these steps in order BEFORE invoking any L1 / L2 /
L3 dispatch on a returning session:

1. **Scan workspace.** Call
   `devolaflow.workspace_context.scan_workspace(repo_root)` —
   returns frozen `WorkspaceContext` snapshot. If `active_changes`
   is empty, no resume protocol applies; proceed to fresh dispatch.
2. **Pick the candidate active change.** When `active_changes`
   contains > 1 entry, prefer the one whose `last_updated` is most
   recent. The append-only handoff store guarantees `last_updated`
   is monotonic per change, so "most recent" is unambiguous.
3. **Read STATUS.yaml.** The fields needed are:
   - `state` ∈ {PROPOSED, IN_PROGRESS, VERIFYING} → resume-eligible.
     `state == PROPOSED` is stale-OK (work hasn't started).
     `state == ESCALATED` requires human review BEFORE resume.
     `state == ARCHIVED` is terminal — never resume.
   - `last_updated` (ISO-8601). Compute staleness:
     `now() - last_updated`. If `> 7 days`, emit a warning;
     if `> 30 days`, recommend operator review (see "Stale-change
     pruning" below).
   - `last_handoff_seq` (int). The append-only seq counter the
     resume dispatch must respect.
4. **Reconcile handoff envelopes.** Read `.local/.agent/handoff/`
   and compute `max_seq = max(seq for envelope where change-id
   matches)`. Cross-check vs `STATUS.yaml.last_handoff_seq`:
   - `max_seq == last_handoff_seq` → in sync; resume normally.
   - `max_seq == last_handoff_seq + 1` → an envelope was written
     but STATUS.yaml was not updated (e.g. crash between writes).
     Re-read the latest envelope; `STATUS.yaml.last_handoff_seq`
     is treated as authoritative and bumped to `max_seq`.
   - `max_seq > last_handoff_seq + 1` → multiple unrecorded
     envelopes. EMIT a `ReconciliationWarning` and treat the
     latest envelope as the resume entry point.
5. **Read goal.md + acceptance.md + spec.md + tasks.md.** Per
   C-9 token budgets, all 4 fit in ~2K tokens combined. Identify
   the first un-checked task in `tasks.md` as the resume entry
   point — that's the first L3 dispatch target.

### Resume dispatch contract — `change_context` field

The next dispatch payload MUST include the `change_context` field
at canonical position 16 (per A-2.2 append-only tail), populated
from STATUS.yaml + the active folder:

```yaml
change_context:
  change_id: <STATUS.yaml.change_id>
  active_folder: ".local/.agent/active/<change_id>"
  state: <STATUS.yaml.state>           # IN_PROGRESS | VERIFYING
  spec_delta_target: <spec.md frontmatter delta_target>
  owned_files_ref: ".local/.agent/active/<change_id>/owned_files.txt"
  acceptance_ref: ".local/.agent/active/<change_id>/acceptance.md"
  resume_from_seq: <STATUS.yaml.last_handoff_seq + 1>
  resume_rationale: "resume after pause; idle <duration>"
```

The `resume_from_seq` field is the dispatch's prescribed seq for
the L0->L? handoff envelope it authors. Convergence-round counters
in `STATUS.yaml.gate_score` / round metadata are preserved
across resume — the round number is keyed by `change_id`, not
session_id.

### Concurrency-safe resume — O_EXCL semantics

`HandoffStore.write_envelope()` opens with `O_EXCL` (per §6 envelope
schema and §5 Python API), so two parallel resume attempts in
different sessions cannot collide on the same seq. The losing
attempt raises `EnvelopeImmutableError` and the operator can either:

1. Retry with `seq+2` (the audit trail records both attempts), or
2. Abort and re-scan workspace to pick up the winning attempt's
   handoff envelope as the new `last_handoff_seq`.

Either path preserves S-9 append-only — never modifies an existing
envelope. Both paths are logged (S-5 — explicit error states).

### Stale-change pruning (operator-facing recommendation)

When staleness threshold > 30 days AND `state == IN_PROGRESS`, the
resume protocol's recommendation is:

| Operator decision | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Continue | Proceed with normal resume (the staleness is just informational) |
| Archive | Run `/devola:verify` then `/devola:archive` per §3 lifecycle FSM transitions; A-4 source-of-truth merge proposal flows from there |
| Escalate | Set `STATUS.yaml.state = ESCALATED` and document the rationale in a NEW handoff envelope (`seq+1`) — preserves the audit trail |

The threshold (30 days) is documentation-only; operators may
override based on project context. The 7-day softer threshold
("emit warning") is the cross-week interruption signal; the
30-day harder threshold suggests abandonment or re-prioritization.

### Cross-references

- `STATUS.yaml` schema (§4 above; v8.2.4 — fields `state`,
  `last_updated`, `last_handoff_seq` are the resume-protocol
  contract).
- Handoff envelope append-only — Soul rule S-9
  (`.cursor/rules/repo-governance.mdc`).
- `change_context` dispatch field at canonical position 16
  (§12 below; v9.7.0 PV-02; A-2.2 append-only-tail invariant).
- `references/execution-protocol.md` §2 Checkpoint/Resume
  Mechanism — covers stage-gate-level resume (different scope:
  cycle vs change vs session).
- W-19 cycle-archive boundary — resume protocol applies to
  ACTIVE changes; archived changes are TERMINAL and cannot be
  resumed (re-archival is a no-op per §1 lifecycle FSM).
- A-4 source-of-truth merge rule — stale-change pruning's
  archive path goes through the gate per A-4.
- `src/devolaflow/skills/change_activation.py::activation_verdict`
  with `force_no_change=True` (v10.5.0 PV-03 D-A-4) — operator
  override on resume when ad-hoc dispatch is preferred over the
  full scaffold.

## 4. Per-Artifact Schemas

Each artifact in `active/<id>/` and `archive/<date>-<id>/` is governed by a
schema in `schemas/agent-workspace/` (v8.2.4). Token budgets are enforced
by Rule C-9 + `python -m devolaflow.agent_workspace.lint <change-id>` (v8.2.5).

| `render_change_report(change_id, ...) -> str` | Per-archive REPORT.md (what changed / why / how / verification / files / learnings / handoff chain) |
| `render_workspace_report(...) -> str` | `.local/.agent/REPORT.md` aggregate (active changes + recently archived) |
| `render_memory_report(...) -> str` | `.local/memory/REPORT.md` (learnings counts, top high-confidence, external source reviews) |
| `render_rules_report(...) -> str` | `.rules/REPORT.md` (per-layer rule counts, compile target status) |
| `regenerate_all(repo_root) -> dict[str, Path]` | Regenerate all 4 REPORT.md files; returns `{report_kind: path_written}` |

CLI: `python -m devolaflow.agent_workspace.reporter --all` (or
`--change <id>` / `--workspace` / `--memory` / `--rules`). Opt-in only —
no auto-trigger from existing workflows yet.

### Backward-compat invariants (R5)

- This package adds NO new public symbol to `devolaflow.__init__`.
- `learnings.py`'s 14 existing public functions stay byte-identical
  (verified by `tests/test_learnings.py` — invariant I-PV05-B).
- `compressor.py::assert_dispatch_layout` accepts BOTH v4 (15 keys) AND v5
  (16 keys, `change_context` appended at position 16) payloads — invariant
  I-PV05-C.

## 6. Handoff Protocol

The `.local/.agent/handoff/` directory is the ONLY supported channel for
inter-agent messaging in DevolaFlow's 4-layer hierarchy. Replaces the
previous in-memory dispatch path; persists across sessions; survives
restarts; auditable.

### File naming

```
.local/.agent/handoff/<from>__<to>__<change-id>__<seq>.yaml
```

- `<from>`, `<to>`: layer identifiers — `L0` / `L1` / `L2` / `L3`
- `<change-id>`: lowercase-kebab-case, identifies the active change
- `<seq>`: monotonic integer starting at 1, zero-padded to 4 digits

Example: `L0__L2__add-dark-mode__0001.yaml` (first dispatch from Project to Wave).

### Envelope schema

Discriminator: `envelope_kind` selects one of three variants:

| `envelope_kind` | Direction | Variant body |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------|
| `TaskDispatch` | parent → child | `dispatch:` block (task_id, type, acceptance_criteria_ref, owned_files_ref, predecessor_artifact_refs) |
| `StatusReport` | child → parent | `report:` block (task_id, state, artifacts, metrics with tests_passed / coverage_pct / findings_by_severity) |
| `EscalationEvent` | child → parent (or upward) | `escalation:` block (severity, trigger, proposed_action) |

Full YAML envelope schema: `schemas/agent-workspace/handoff-envelope.yaml`.

### Append-only invariant (Rule S-9, Soul P0)

Once a `<from>__<to>__<change-id>__<seq>.yaml` envelope exists, it MUST NOT
be modified or deleted by any agent. To convey new information, the agent
MUST author a new envelope with `seq+1`.

Rationale: append-only ledger prevents silent overwrites between agents
operating in parallel. Mirrors P5 (Artifacts as Contracts) and the message-
schemas P3 contract in `references/message-schemas.md`.

Enforcement:

- `tests/test_handoff_envelope_immutable.py` (v8.2.4) — CI lint
- `lifecycle/check_envelope_append_only` hook (v8.2.5) — write-time block in STRICT mode
- `HandoffStore.write_envelope()` raises `EnvelopeImmutableError` on seq collision

### Inbox/outbox semantics

For an agent operating at layer `Lk`:

- **Inbox** = envelopes where `<to> == Lk` AND `<change-id>` matches active change
- **Outbox** = envelopes where `<from> == Lk` AND `<change-id>` matches active change

`HandoffStore.list_inbox(layer, change_id)` and `list_outbox(layer, change_id)`
return envelopes sorted by ascending `seq`. To compute the next seq for
authoring an outgoing envelope: `next_seq = max(existing_seqs) + 1`, atomic
under file-write race conditions via `O_EXCL` open.

## 7. Source-of-Truth Specs (M-004 / Rule A-4)

`.local/memory/specs/<domain>/spec.md` is the source-of-truth for current
system behavior. Per-change `.local/.agent/active/<id>/spec.md` files contain
DELTAS (ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED Requirements) relative to source-of-truth.

### Why deltas, not full specs

- **Lifecycle separation**: in-flight proposals (active/) and agreed contracts
  (memory/specs/) have different governance windows. A proposal can be
  rejected without contaminating the contract.
- **Audit trail**: every change archive preserves the proposed delta, so the
  archive log answers "what did we add to spec X across all of v8.3.0?"
- **Token economy**: a delta is dramatically smaller than re-stating the
  whole spec, fitting comfortably in the 1500-token soft budget.

### Archive-time merge proposal (NOT auto-applied)

Source-of-truth is mutated ONLY at archive time, after the gate has PASSED
(W-3 / SI-3 composite ≥ 8.5 for minor changes, ≥ 9.0 for major). The gate
runs the explicit `mergeability_check` (v8.2.5 reporter module) before
allowing the merge.

`ArchiveManager.propose_merge(change_id) -> MergeProposal` returns a structured
proposal that a human (or downstream automation) explicitly applies — never
auto-merged. This preserves W-3 / SI-3 + W-4 / SI-4 invariants.

### ADDED / MODIFIED / REMOVED semantics

| Section | Effect on source-of-truth |
|---------|---------------------------|
| `## ADDED Requirements` | Append new headings to source-of-truth spec; collision with existing heading raises `MergeConflict` |
| `## MODIFIED Requirements` | Replace existing heading body in source-of-truth (heading must already exist) |
| `## REMOVED Requirements` | Delete heading from source-of-truth (heading must already exist) |

Each requirement uses RFC 2119 keywords (MUST / MUST NOT / SHOULD / MAY) and
optional Scenario blocks (GIVEN / WHEN / THEN). Format borrowed verbatim from
OpenSpec — adopted in v8.3.0 per `.local/research/v8.3.0_openspec_deep_analysis.md`.

## 8. REPORT.md Surface

Auto-generated, human-readable reports at four locations. Generator API in
`src/devolaflow/agent_workspace/reporter.py` (v8.2.7).

### `archive/<date>-<id>/REPORT.md` (per-change)

Auto-generated at `/devola:archive` time (or manual `render_change_report()`
call). Template:

```markdown
# Change Report: <change-id>
> Archived <YYYY-MM-DD> | Author: <session_id> | Duration: <hh:mm:ss>

## What changed
<Auto-extracted from spec.md ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED sections>

## Why
<Verbatim from goal.md `## Why` section>

## How
<Auto-extracted from spec.md `## Purpose` + tasks.md `## N. <group>` headings>

## Verification
- AC pass rate: <X/Y>
- Tests passed: <int>
- Coverage: <pct>%
- Lint: <pass|fail>
- Format: <pass|fail>
- Gate score: <float>/10

## Files touched
<owned_files.txt verbatim>

## Learnings extracted
- <insight 1> (confidence: 0.X)
- <insight 2> (confidence: 0.Y)

## Handoff chain summary
- L0 → L2 (T01 dispatch) → L3 (T01 work) → L2 (T01 report) → L0 (gate eval)
```

### `.local/.agent/REPORT.md` (workspace aggregate)

Active vs. archived dashboard. Tables: Active changes (id, state, %, owner,
last touch), Recently archived (last 7 days; id, archived date, duration,
gate score). Auto-regenerates on every state transition.

### `.local/memory/REPORT.md` (memory aggregate)

Learnings counts by task type, top 10 high-confidence learnings (last 30
days), recent external-source reviews from `reference-dependencies.yaml`.

### `.rules/REPORT.md` (rules-coverage aggregate)

Per-layer rule counts, always-apply flags, token estimates. Compile-target
status (cursor `repo-governance.mdc` last compile date + drift verdict;
agents_md `AGENTS.md` last compile date + drift verdict).

### CLI invocation

```bash
python -m devolaflow.agent_workspace.reporter --all                # all 4 reports
python -m devolaflow.agent_workspace.reporter --change add-dark-mode
python -m devolaflow.agent_workspace.reporter --workspace
python -m devolaflow.agent_workspace.reporter --memory
python -m devolaflow.agent_workspace.reporter --rules
```

Opt-in semantics (I-PV07-A): no existing workflow auto-triggers reporter;
explicit invocation only. Plays nicely with W-9 SI-10 — adding the reporter
to a developer's pre-commit hook is OPTIONAL.

## 9. Token Budgets (Rule C-9)

Verbatim from `.cursor/rules/repo-governance.mdc` C-9:

| File | Soft budget | Hard ceiling | Rationale |
|------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| `goal.md` | 200 tokens | 400 | Single-paragraph intent; verbose prose forbidden |
| `acceptance.md` | 400 tokens | 800 | Checkbox list; one AC per line |
| `spec.md` | 1500 tokens | 3000 | ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED sections; OpenSpec-style |
| `tasks.md` | 800 tokens | 1500 | Hierarchical numbered checkboxes |
| `STATUS.yaml` | 100 tokens | 200 | YAML frontmatter only; no prose |
| `owned_files.txt` | 50 tokens | 100 | One path per line; max 6 writable per task |
| `learnings.jsonl` | (no token limit) | 50 KB file size | Bounded by JSONL line count + decay |
| `REPORT.md` (per archive) | 1500 tokens | 3000 | Auto-generated; templated |
| Handoff envelope | 600 tokens | 1200 | YAML envelope with `key_facts` (verbatim per CO-2) |

Verify with:

```bash
python -m devolaflow.agent_workspace.lint <change-id>
```

Soft budget over → warn (lite mode). Hard ceiling over → fail commit (full
mode and STRICT). Couples with W-9 SI-10 step 1 (pytest) when the change-id
is enrolled in the `change-driven` workflow's pre-commit gate.

## 10. File-Ownership Constraint (Rule S-8)

When an L3 Task Agent is operating inside a `change-driven` workflow with
an active change folder, it MUST NOT modify any file outside the union of:

1. paths listed in `.local/.agent/active/<change-id>/owned_files.txt`
2. the change folder itself (`active/<change-id>/`)
3. its own outbox in `.local/.agent/handoff/` (append-only — see §6)

Violations:

- Detected at file-write time via `lifecycle/check_file_ownership` hook
- In `mode: lite` — warn + log
- In `mode: full` (or STRICT) — block + escalate per P4

Exceptions:

- Trivial single-file edits < 20 lines (P1 trivial waiver also applies here)
- L0/L1/L2 dispatcher reads (Read/Glob/Grep/SemanticSearch) are unrestricted

Source: Rule S-8 in `.cursor/rules/repo-governance.mdc`.

## 11. Workflow Template Integration

The `change-driven` workflow template (`workflow-system/agent/templates/builtin/
change-driven.yaml`, v8.2.6) wires the lifecycle FSM (§3) into DevolaFlow's
stage primitives (`references/meta-framework.md`):

| Stage | Primitive | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `propose` | `design` | Scaffold `active/<id>/` with goal+acceptance+spec+tasks+STATUS+owned_files |
| `apply` | `implement` | Loop L3 dispatches until tasks.md all checkboxes ticked |
| `verify` | `verify` | Run AC checklist; gate composite must PASS per W-3 |
| `archive` | `deploy` | Move active → archive; auto-generate REPORT.md; consolidate per-change learnings to global memory; PROPOSE delta merge to source-of-truth (NOT auto-apply) |

Composition: `sequence(propose → loop(apply, verify) → archive)`.
Loop terminates when `verify.pass_rate == 1.0 AND verify.gate_score >= verify.threshold`,
max 5 iterations, on-exhaustion = escalate.

The `archive_gate` runs BEFORE the `archive` stage with criteria
`verify.pass_rate == 1.0 AND verify.gate_score >= 8.5`; failure escalates
and requires human override.

Mode parameter:

| Mode | Pre-commit gate steps |
|------|----------------------|
| `lite` (default) | Steps 1–3 of W-9 SI-10 (tests, lint, format) — single-author, low-risk |
| `full` | All 6 steps of W-9 SI-10 — multi-author or high-risk |

Set in `.local/.agent/config.yaml` `mode:` field, or override per-dispatch
via the workflow's `parameters.mode` config.

## 12. Cache Layout v5 (M-006)

Dispatch payloads in change-driven mode optionally include a `change_context`
top-level field at canonical position 16 (schema v5):

```yaml
change_context:
  change_id: <id>
  active_folder: ".local/.agent/active/<id>"
  state: PROPOSED|IN_PROGRESS|VERIFYING
  spec_delta_target: <domain>
  owned_files_ref: ".local/.agent/active/<id>/owned_files.txt"
  acceptance_ref: ".local/.agent/active/<id>/acceptance.md"
```

Per Rule 6 (P6 Preserve Cached Prefix), positions 1–15 remain byte-identical
to v4 — `change_context` is appended at the end. `assert_dispatch_layout()`
accepts BOTH v4 (15 keys) AND v5 (16 keys) payloads (invariant I-PV05-C).
When `change_context` is absent, dispatch is a "free-floating" workflow
(current v4 behavior preserved).
