# Context Isolation Reference

## 1. Isolation Principles
From §6.1:

Context isolation prevents three failure modes:

| # | Failure Mode | Description | Consequence If Not Prevented |
|---|-------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| 1 | **Context pollution** | Task Agent's working memory fills with irrelevant information from other tasks | Degraded output quality; agent reasoning contaminated |
| 2 | **Cross-task interference** | Parallel tasks inadvertently share or conflict on information | Inconsistent results; hidden dependencies |
| 3 | **Budget exhaustion** | Accumulated context from multiple phases exceeds effective context window | Degraded reasoning; important details lost from attention |

These failure modes are observed across agent frameworks (MetaGPT pub-sub
pollution, OpenHands context overflow). The isolation strategy prevents
all three through enforcement at spawn time.

## 2. Isolation Mechanisms
From §6.2:

### Mechanism 1 — Fresh Context Per Spawn

Every Task Agent (Layer 3) starts with an empty context window. It receives
ONLY the TaskDispatch message and the files listed in `owned_files`. No
conversation history from prior tasks leaks in.

### Mechanism 2 — File Ownership Boundaries

Each Task Agent is authorized to read/modify ONLY files listed in its
`TaskDispatch.context.owned_files`. File ownership is partitioned at the
Wave level — no two tasks in the same wave share a writable file.

### Mechanism 3 — Artifact-Mediated Communication

Tasks never directly communicate. When Task B depends on Task A's output:

```
Task A writes to file
  → Wave Agent collects result
    → Task B receives a SUMMARY REFERENCE in context injection
      (NOT the full content)
```

## 3. Context Injection Template
From §6.3:

Every Task Agent receives this structured context at spawn time. This is
the ONLY information the Task Agent has access to (beyond its own tool outputs).

```yaml
context_injection:

  # Section 1: Identity and role (~100 tokens)
  identity:
    role: "string"                     # research | design | implement | test | review
    task_id: "string"                  # e.g., S03_W02_T01
    team: "string"                     # AgentTeam role template to follow

  # Section 2: Task specification (500-1500 tokens)
  task:
    title: "string"                    # short descriptive title
    description: "string"             # detailed what-to-do
    acceptance_criteria: ["string"]    # testable done-when conditions
    constraints: ["string"]           # non-negotiable boundaries

  # Section 3: Scoped context (1000-3000 tokens)
  context:
    predecessor_summary: "string"      # 3-5 sentence summary (NOT full artifacts)
    design_reference_excerpt: "string | null"  # relevant section ONLY (NOT full doc)
    relevant_interfaces: ["string"]    # interface signatures to respect

  # Section 4: File scope (200-500 tokens)
  files:
    owned:                             # files agent can create/modify
      - path: "string"
        purpose: "string"             # why this file is relevant
    read_only:                         # files agent can read but NOT modify
      - path: "string"
        purpose: "string"

  # Section 5: Rules (loaded per guide.md protocol) (2000-5000 tokens)
  rules:
    loading_strategy: "minimal | standard | full"
    language: "string | null"
    task_type: "string | null"
    quality_focus: ["string"]

  # Section 6: Behavioral constraints (~200 tokens)
  behavioral:
    timeout_seconds: "integer"
    max_files_to_read: "integer"       # prevent context blow-up
    output_format: "string"            # expected output structure
    escalation_contact: "wave_agent"   # who to escalate to
```

### Section Token Budgets

| Section | Tokens | Content |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Identity | ~100 | role, task_id, team |
| Task spec | 500–1500 | title, description, acceptance_criteria, constraints |
| Scoped context | 1000–3000 | predecessor_summary, design_excerpt, interfaces |
| File scope | 200–500 | owned files (create/modify), read_only files |
| Rules | 2000–5000 | Loaded per code-rules protocol |
| Behavioral | ~200 | timeout, max_files, output_format, escalation |
| **Total** | **~3800–10300** | Leaves 150K–490K for reasoning + tool outputs |

## 4. What MUST NOT Leak Between SubAgents
From §6.4:

| # | Category | What Must Not Leak | Why |
|---|----------|-------------------|-----|
| 1 | **Conversation history** | Prior task's internal reasoning, tool calls, intermediate outputs | Pollutes new task's reasoning with irrelevant context |
| 2 | **File contents from other tasks** | Source code files owned by other parallel tasks | Prevents false dependencies and conflicting assumptions |
| 3 | **Full predecessor artifacts** | Complete research reports, design documents, review reports | Context budget exhaustion; summaries are sufficient |
| 4 | **Error details from siblings** | Stack traces, failure logs from sibling tasks | Irrelevant to current task; may confuse the agent |
| 5 | **Quality scores from other tasks** | Review scores, coverage metrics from unrelated modules | Could create false pressure to match or exceed |
| 6 | **Deferred items from other stages** | Items explicitly pushed to later stages | Not actionable for the current task |

## 5. What IS Shared (Via Artifact Summaries)
From §6.4:

| Category | How Shared | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Interface contracts | Function signatures, type definitions from predecessor stages | `trait ConfigSource { fn load(&self) -> Result<Config>; }` |
| Design decisions | ADR summaries that constrain the current task | "Decision: use TOML over YAML for config (rationale: ...)" |
| Naming conventions | Project-wide patterns from code-rules | `snake_case` for Rust, module naming patterns |
| Quality thresholds | Acceptance criteria from project configuration | "coverage >= 80%, zero blockers" |
| Acceptance criteria | From the task's own TaskDispatch | Binary testable conditions |

**Key rule:** Share summaries and contracts, never full content.
Predecessor artifacts are summarized to 3-5 sentences max.

## 6. Context Budget Management by Layer
From §6.5:

| Layer | Strategy | Budget | What's Loaded | Max Files | Max Tokens |
|-------|----------|--------|---------------|-----------|------------|
| L0 Project | Minimal | ~3K | Workflow template, project config, stage status dashboard | 3 | 3000 |
| L1 Stage | Standard | ~5K | Stage definition, predecessor artifact summaries, wave plan | 5 | 5000 |
| L2 Wave | Minimal | ~4K | Wave task list, task status tracking | 3 | 4000 |
| L3 Task | Standard–Full | ~8K | Task spec, owned files, code-rules, design excerpt | 15 (read) + 6 (write) | 8000 |

### Loading Strategy Reference

| Strategy | Description | Used By |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Minimal** | Only essential context; no file contents, no deep references | L0 Project, L2 Wave |
| **Standard** | Essential context + key excerpts from predecessor artifacts | L1 Stage, L3 Task (typical) |
| **Full** | Standard + complete code-rules + detailed design references | L3 Task (complex tasks) |

### Budget Enforcement Rules

1. **Hard caps:** No layer may exceed its token budget for context injection
2. **Summarization:** Artifacts exceeding budget are auto-summarized before injection
3. **Prioritization:** Identity > Task spec > Rules > Context > Files (in priority order)
4. **Overflow handling:** If budget exceeded after prioritization, truncate lowest-priority
   sections and add `[TRUNCATED — load full content via Read tool if needed]` marker

### File Limits by Layer

| Layer | Max Writable Files | Max Readable Files | File Content in Context? |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| L0 Project | 2 (dashboard, config) | 3 | NO (paths only) |
| L1 Stage | 2 (README, report) | 5 | Summaries only |
| L2 Wave | 0 (in-memory only) | 3 | NO (paths only) |
| L3 Task | 6 | 15 | YES (owned files loaded) |

## 7. Context Injection Checklist

Use this checklist when building context injection for a Task Agent:

```
CONTEXT INJECTION CHECKLIST
════════════════════════════

□ Identity section populated (role, task_id, team)
□ Task description is self-contained (not referencing external docs by name only)
□ Acceptance criteria are binary-testable
□ Predecessor summary is ≤ 5 sentences (not full artifact)
□ Design excerpt is the relevant section ONLY (not full doc)
□ Interface signatures are complete (types, return types, constraints)
□ Owned files listed with purpose annotations
□ Read-only files listed (dependencies the task needs to reference)
□ No file appears in both owned AND another parallel task's owned
□ Rules loading strategy matches task complexity
□ Timeout is set (default: estimated_minutes × 120 seconds)
□ max_files_to_read is set (prevents context explosion)
□ Total token estimate is within layer budget (~8K for L3)

LEAK PREVENTION CHECKS:
□ No conversation history from prior tasks included
□ No file contents from other parallel tasks included
□ No full predecessor artifacts (summaries only)
□ No error details from sibling tasks
□ No quality scores from unrelated tasks
□ No deferred items from other stages
```

## 8. Information Density Optimization (v2.2.0)

Context injection now supports density-aware loading:

**Task-Adaptive Profiles**: Six profiles (hotfix, research, design, refactor, review, feature) control which SKILL.md sections load per task type. Defined in `context_profiles.yaml`.

**Lean Message Format**: Inter-layer messages (TaskDispatch, StatusReport) use structured compact format. Key changes:
- `key_facts` lists replace paragraph summaries (verbatim extraction, zero hallucination)
- Cause→effect notation for acceptance criteria (e.g., "expired → 401")
- Abbreviated severity codes (B/C/M/m/i)

**Acceptance Readiness Gate**: Pre-workflow validation of acceptance criteria quality. Prevents budget exhaustion from rework caused by vague criteria.

## 9. Debugging Context Issues

### Symptom → Cause → Fix

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Task produces output inconsistent with design | Design excerpt missing or truncated | Expand design_reference_excerpt to cover relevant section |
| Task modifies files it shouldn't | owned_files misconfigured | Audit owned_files list; ensure disjoint within wave |
| Task reasoning seems confused | Context pollution from prior task | Verify fresh context spawn; check no history leakage |
| Task runs out of context mid-reasoning | Budget exhaustion; too much injected | Reduce context injection; use Minimal loading strategy |
| Parallel tasks produce conflicting code | Shared file ownership | Re-partition files; ensure disjoint ownership in wave |
| Task ignores interface contracts | relevant_interfaces not populated | Add interface signatures to context.relevant_interfaces |
| Task quality low despite good design | Rules not loaded or wrong strategy | Check rules.loading_strategy matches task complexity |

## 10. Cache Layout Invariant (v7.0.0+)

Long agent sessions hit a cost wall when the prompt-cache hit rate falls below
~90 %. The single largest operational lever is **structural stability of the
dispatch prefix across convergence rounds** — when round-N restructures the
cached prefix, the host KV-cache rebuilds from scratch (5–10× cost delta on
long sessions).

DevolaFlow declares a single canonical top-level key order for every lean
dispatch. The order is **additive**: each key may be absent, none may be
reordered, and new top-level keys MUST be appended after `gate` (position 12).

**Canonical order (12 keys):** `hdr` → `task` → `goal` → `assumptions` →
`pred` → `files` → `rules` → `shared` → `accept` → `reinforce` (round 2+
only) → `verify_cfg` → `gate`. Source of truth:
`schemas/lean-dispatch.yaml#layout_invariant`.

**Validator:** `devolaflow.compressor.assert_dispatch_layout(payload)` raises
`DispatchLayoutError` on any out-of-order or pre-spec-end unknown key.
`compute_dispatch_lcp_pct(a, b)` returns the round-over-round prefix
stability fraction. **SLO:** LCP ≥ 80 % round 1→2 and ≥ 70 % round 1→3,
enforced by `tests/test_compressor.py::test_dispatch_prefix_is_stable_across_rounds`.
**Rationale:** `.local/research/adr/v7-ADR-001-cache-layout-invariant.md`.

## 11. Tool-Output Truncation (v7.0.1+)

In multi-round convergence, prior-round `tool_use` outputs (Read/Grep/Shell
returns) accumulate inside the predecessor context the L2 wave agent feeds
to the next round's L3 task agents. Anthropic's cookbook (`[ref-6]`) calls
this the "lightest-touch" lever: keep the `tool_use` record (so the model
knows the call happened) but elide the bulky `tool_result` payload once it
falls below a recency threshold. DevolaFlow ships the deterministic
prompt-side equivalent in `devolaflow.compressor` per ADR-002.

**When the runtime applies truncation.** The L3 task agent emits its
`StatusReport` with the full tool_use list. Before the L2 wave agent splices
that report into the next round's predecessor context, it calls
`clear_old_tool_uses(tool_uses, keep=3, exclude_tool_names=("Read",))`.
The default behaviour preserves the most recent 3 tool calls verbatim and
truncates the middle of older outputs (head 500 + placeholder + tail 500
chars). `Read` outputs are exempt from truncation by default because they
represent authoritative file content frequently cited verbatim during code
review. Triggering happens at round ≥ 2 only — round 1 has no
prior-round payloads to clear.

**Policy knobs.** Per-profile in
`workflow-system/agent/context_profiles.yaml`:

```yaml
tool_output_truncation:
  enabled: false                 # default at v7.0.1 cut
  keep: 3                        # most-recent-N preserved verbatim
  exclude_tool_names: ["Read"]   # never-truncated tool names
  head_chars: 500
  tail_chars: 500
```

The six decomposition-enabled profiles (`feature`, `refactor`,
`skill-optimization`, `migration`, `security-audit`, `perf-optimization`)
ship the knob disabled in v7.0.1. Operators opt in per profile after
H.1 retention data confirms safety; v7.1.0 will flip the default to
`enabled: true` cycle-wide.

**Placeholder format.** `truncate_tool_output()` substitutes `{removed}`
in `placeholder_template` (default `"[truncated {removed} chars]"`) with
the count of elided characters. The placeholder is intended for the
*model's* re-ingestion and human scan, not for programmatic JSON parsing —
truncation always lands on character boundaries, not structural ones.

**Reading the `tool_results.summary` block.** `clear_old_tool_uses()`
returns a `ToolUseTruncation` summary that the producing agent records in
`schemas/lean-report.yaml#tool_results.summary` (`kept_count`,
`cleared_count`, `cleared_at_round`). The L2 wave agent inspects the
summary to decide whether to refresh the L1 dispatch tool list:
`cleared_count > 0` is the canonical signal that round-N reused fewer
verbatim tool outputs than round-(N−1) and the cached prefix is starting
to drift. Together with the cache-layout invariant (§10), this is the
prompt-side mechanism for keeping convergence-round dispatches inside
their token budget without sacrificing recent-call fidelity.

**Rationale:** `.local/research/adr/v7-ADR-002-tool-output-truncation.md`.
**Sub-agent budget bump (K.8 resolution):** the same six profiles raise
`decomposition.sub_agent_context_budget` from 3000 → 5000 tokens at the
v7.0.1 cut so a sub-agent can absorb the verbatim recent-N records without
spillover.

## 12. Hierarchical Predecessor Summariser (v7.0.2+)

Predecessor artifacts from the prior stage enter a consuming layer's
dispatch under `pred[*]`. When a single artifact exceeds ~25 % of the
consuming layer's token budget (L3 8000 → 2000 tokens; L2 4000 → 1000
tokens; L1 5000 → 1250 tokens; L0 3000 → 750 tokens), embedding the body
verbatim starves every other dispatch section. DevolaFlow ships
`devolaflow.compressor.summarise_predecessor(artifact_path, *,
max_tokens=500, mode="extractive", schema_hint=None)` as the
deterministic collapse primitive. The extractive pipeline is a
fixed three-stage descent: (1) **schema-priority heading selection** —
`design` favours *Decision* > *Consequences* > *Alternatives*, `research`
favours *Recommendations* > *Open Questions* > *Synthesis*, `adr` favours
*Decision* > *Consequences* > *Test plan*, `gate_report` favours *Verdict* >
*Findings* > *Metrics*, with document-order H2 fallback; (2) **verbatim
preserve-list extraction** via `extract_named_entities()`, which surfaces
all 8 structured classes (file_paths, task_ids, version_strings,
commit_hashes, metric_values, error_messages, acceptance_criterion_bullets,
interface_signatures) as a `key_facts:` YAML prefix; (3) **sentence-level
bounded truncation** — selected sections fill the remaining `max_tokens`
budget in priority order; when a section would overflow, the renderer
inserts `[TRUNCATED]` at the token boundary and emits `was_bounded=True`.
No paraphrase ever occurs on the default path, honouring CO-2 by
construction.

Profile knobs live under each profile's `summary:` block in
`workflow-system/agent/context_profiles.yaml` (fields `mode`, `max_tokens`,
`trigger_pct`). Per-dispatch overrides travel on `pred[*].summary_mode`
and `pred[*].summary_max_tokens` — both declared in
`schemas/lean-dispatch.yaml#per_predecessor` and appended nested inside
each pred entry, *never* as new top-level keys, to preserve the §10
cache-layout invariant. Missing fields default to `extractive` / 500
tokens. Abstractive mode is reserved for narrative stage reports and
opts in per profile; it still runs the extractive pass first so the
preserve-list facts travel verbatim, and is guarded by the §13
persistence probe against named-entity drift. At the v7.1.0 cut the six
decomposition-enabled profiles (`feature`, `refactor`,
`skill-optimization`, `migration`, `security-audit`, `perf-optimization`)
default to `summary.mode: extractive` with `max_tokens: 1200` —
roomier than the schema default because these profiles consume 5000-
token sub-agent contexts.

**Rationale:** `.local/research/adr/v7-ADR-003-hierarchical-summary.md`.

## 13. Persistence Probe (v7.0.3+)

`summarise_predecessor()` is the only primitive that can silently
paraphrase a file path or a commit hash — losing a single such entity
between Stage A and Stage B breaks the P5 artifact contract and burns
a convergence round on search-instead-of-execute rabbit holes. The
persistence probe is the deterministic integration guard that catches
this failure. The harness lives in `tests/test_e2e_compression.py`
(with seed logic in `tests/_probe_fixtures.py`): it synthesises a
Stage A artifact seeded with a preserve-list panel, runs it through
`summarise_predecessor` + `render_dispatch` + `task_adaptive_selector.
select_context`, then calls `compute_entity_carrythrough_rate()` to
measure the fraction of Stage A entities that appear verbatim in the
rendered Stage B dispatch. Any paraphrase, case-fold on a
file-path/commit-hash, or outright omission fails the probe with a
diagnostic naming the lost entity.

Three scenarios ship at the v7.0.3 cut, matched to the H.1 retention
tiers: **easy** (500-token artifact, 5 seeded entities, rate ≥ 1.0,
0 misses), **medium** (5000-token artifact, 20 seeded entities, rate
≥ 0.9, ≤ 2 misses), **hard** (15000-token artifact, 50 seeded
entities, rate ≥ 0.9, ≤ 5 misses). Per-scenario elapsed time plus
the realised carry-through rate land in
`.local/research/v7.0.3_probe_telemetry.json` after each run, feeding
SI-3 evaluation. The probe is marked `@pytest.mark.persistence_probe`
and runs in the default pytest suite so SI-10 step 5 cannot merge a
summariser regression.

**Rationale:** `.local/research/adr/v7-ADR-004-persistence-probe.md`.

## 14. Operational Learnings v2 (v7.0.3+)

`src/devolaflow/learnings.py` gains four additive `Learning` fields —
`confidence_half_life_days` (default 30), `last_accessed` (ISO
timestamp), `pinned_for_session` (session id or empty), `promotion_count`
(monotonic) — plus three public helpers: `consolidate_session(session_id,
session_learnings, jsonl_path)` promotes learnings actually used during a
session (+0.05 confidence, `promotion_count++`, refreshed `last_accessed`)
or captures novel ones with `promotion_count=1`; `decay_confidence(
jsonl_path, half_life_days=None)` applies linear decay across the file;
`pin_learning_for_session(key, stage, task_type, session_id, jsonl_path)`
attaches a session pin. `load_relevant_learnings()` accepts the new
`session_id: str | None` parameter — when supplied, pinned entries for
that session are surfaced ahead of the confidence-sorted top-N and
bypass `min_confidence` (TTL + `task_type` still apply). The four new
fields default to safe zero-equivalents so legacy JSONL parses unchanged
via `Learning(**fields)` filtered through `Learning.__dataclass_fields__`.

Decay is a single linear sweep per call: for every entry,
`delta_days = (now - last_accessed)` in UTC days; `decay_factor =
min(1.0, delta_days / entry.confidence_half_life_days)`; `new_conf =
confidence - 0.5 * decay_factor`. The result is clamped to `[0.0, 1.0]`
and every entry whose new confidence falls strictly below `DECAY_FLOOR =
0.1` is pruned in-place. Pinned entries survive pruning regardless of
confidence. ADR-005 §2.4's migration shim is lazy and per-entry: on the
first `decay_confidence()` touch of a legacy v1 entry, `last_accessed`
is backfilled from the existing `timestamp` so the linear formula has a
stable anchor — no file-wide rewrite is forced and no writer ever
overwrites a non-empty `last_accessed`.

**Rationale:** `.local/research/adr/v7-ADR-005-learnings-v2.md`.

## 15. Staged Compression — End-to-End Flow (v7.1.0+)

The v7.0.x primitives compose across a convergence run as a single
context-compression staircase. Each row below describes the primitive's
active scope; rows downstream of a row do not disturb rows upstream.

| Stage                   | Round | Primitive                              | Reference | Scope                                                                          |
|-------------------------|-------|----------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dispatch render         | 1+    | Cache-layout invariant                 | §10       | Freezes the 12-key top-level order so round-N reuses round-(N−1)'s KV prefix.  |
| Predecessor embed       | 1+    | Hierarchical summariser                | §12       | Collapses pred artifact > 25 % of layer budget via `summarise_predecessor()`.  |
| Predecessor embed       | 1+    | Preserve-list extraction               | §12 / §13 | `extract_named_entities()` surfaces 8 structured classes verbatim.             |
| L3 status → L2 context  | ≥ 2   | Tool-output truncation                 | §11       | `clear_old_tool_uses(keep=3, exclude=["Read"])` elides prior-round payloads.   |
| L1 → L2 → L3 pipeline   | 1+    | Persistence probe                      | §13       | CI assertion that preserve-list entities carry through Stage A → Stage B.      |
| Session end             | n/a   | Learnings consolidation / decay        | §14       | `consolidate_session()` bumps used learnings; `decay_confidence()` prunes.     |
| Next session load       | n/a   | Pinned-session surfacing               | §14       | `load_relevant_learnings(session_id=...)` surfaces pinned entries first.       |

At v7.1.0 the six decomposition-enabled profiles default to
`tool_output_truncation.enabled: true` **and** `summary.mode: extractive`
(opt-out per profile in `workflow-system/agent/context_profiles.yaml`).
The other profiles remain opt-in. Dispatch renderers that predate the
new `summary:` block continue to work: absent fields fall through to the
schema defaults (`extractive` / 500 tokens).

**Rollback posture.** Each primitive is individually reversible without
destabilising the others: disabling truncation per profile leaves the
summariser and probe untouched; removing the `summary:` block falls
through to the schema default; the persistence probe is pure test code;
learnings v2 fields are additive with safe defaults. Removing any single
primitive does NOT require a version rollback — only the coupled bundle
(SKILL.md + context profiles + compressor) needs a coordinated revert,
which the `scripts/bump_version.py` harness and SI-5 coupling already
gate.

## 15. Abstractive summariser Stage A (P-12, v8.0.0)

`summarise_predecessor(..., mode='abstractive')` is now wired via a
deterministic Stage A heuristic (no LLM). It complements the extractive
default by routing each parsed section through `_compute_information_density`
(unique-token ratio × 0.6 + entity-density signal × 0.4, both bounded to
`[0.0, 1.0]`) and switching to a denser representation when the body is
dilute:

* **Low-density sections** (`< 0.30`) collapse to ≤ 2 lines via
  `_summarise_low_density_section` — heading + first key phrase.
* **High-density sections** (`≥ 0.30`) preserve up to 5 lines via
  `_summarise_high_density_section`; if the verbatim slice would drop
  any named entity reported by `extract_named_entities`, an
  `entities: [...]` line is appended (entity preservation always wins
  over verbatim tail per AC #4 of the P-12 patch plan).
* **Empty input** falls back to the extractive path (defensive — keeps
  the v7.x byte-stable behaviour for blank artifacts).

Opt-in via `context_profiles.yaml#complex_feature.summary_mode`
= `abstractive` (top-level section, sibling to `meta:`/`sections:`/
`profiles:`, NOT a new profile — keeps profile count stable). All
existing profiles remain `extractive` (CO-2 verbatim). Stage B
(LLM-assisted, v8.2.0 PV-01) design lives in
`.local/research/v8.0.0_p12_abstractive_stage_b_design.md`.
