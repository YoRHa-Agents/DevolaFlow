# Decomposition & Gate Mechanism Reference

## 1. Decomposition Principles
From §1:

| Principle | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **D1 Monotonic Granularity** | Project → Stage → Wave → Task. Each level strictly increases granularity. A Task never spans two Stages. |
| **D2 Dependency Completeness** | Every dependency explicitly declared. Graph must be a DAG — cycles prohibited. |
| **D3 Bounded Atomicity** | Tasks atomic: ≤30 min (impl), ≤45 min (research). Exceeds bound → decompose further. |
| **D4 Gate-Before-Advance** | No downstream Stage begins until upstream Stage's gate = PASS. |
| **D5 Deterministic Decomposition** | Same spec + workflow type → same Stage/Wave/Task structure. |

## 2. Stage Decomposition
From §2:

### Stage Boundary Criteria

| Criterion | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Team Transition | Primary AgentTeam role changes | Design → Implement |
| Artifact Gate | Significant artifact must be validated | Design doc must pass review |
| Quality Checkpoint | Formal quality evaluation required | Code must pass test/review gate |
| Risk Isolation | Failure should not corrupt prior results | Test failures don't modify reviewed code |
| Context Reset | Working context shifts enough for fresh agent | Research mode → code-writing mode |

### Stage Definition Schema

```yaml
stage_definition:
  stage_id: "S{nn}"                      # S01, S02, etc.

```
Format:  S{nn}_{snake_case_name}     (e.g., S01_research, S04_implement)
Rules:   Two-digit zero-padded index, snake_case max 20 chars, unique within workflow
```

## 3. Wave Decomposition
From §3:

### Wave Formation Algorithm

```
ALGORITHM: WaveDecomposition(stage_definition, task_list)

1. BUILD dependency graph G (nodes=tasks, edges=depends_on + file conflicts)
2. DETECT cycles → ERROR if found
3. COMPUTE topological layers (Kahn's algorithm):
     layer[0] = tasks with in-degree 0
     layer[n+1] = tasks with all deps in layers 0..n
4. PARTITION each layer into waves:
     FOR each topological layer:
       WHILE unassigned tasks remain:
         wave = new Wave()
         FOR each unassigned task:
           IF wave.count < 5
           AND task.owned_files ∩ wave.owned_files == ∅:
             wave.add(task)
         EMIT wave
5. NUMBER waves: W01, W02, ..., W{nn}
```

### Wave Constraints

| Constraint | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Max tasks per wave | 5 | Prevents Wave Agent context overload |
| Min tasks per wave | 1 | Single-task waves valid (scaffold) |
| Max waves per stage | 7 | Observed ceiling across project analysis |
| File ownership | Disjoint (strict) | No two tasks in a wave write same file |
| Read-only sharing | Allowed | Multiple tasks may read same file |

### Wave Pattern Library
From §3.7:

| Pattern | Structure | Use When |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| scaffold_then_parallel | W01:[scaffold] → W02:[A,B,C,D] → W03:[integration] | Impl stage with independent modules |
| research_fanout | W01:[research_a, research_b] → W02:[synthesis] | Research surveying independent topics |
| sequential_pipeline | W01:[a] → W02:[b] → W03:[c] | Strongly ordered work, same files |
| convergence_round | W01:[review] → W02:[fix] → W03:[test] → W04:[fix] | Inside convergence loop stages |
| parallel_review | W01:[review_code, review_sec, review_arch] → W02:[aggregate] | Multi-dimension review |

## 4. Task Decomposition
From §4:

### Task Sizing Rules

```
HARD LIMITS:
  Max wall-clock:    30 min (implementation) / 45 min (research/design)
  Max files owned:   6 writable files
  Max lines changed: ~300 lines net
  Max files read:    15 files

SOFT TARGETS:
  Ideal wall-clock:  10–20 min
  Ideal files owned: 2–4 writable files
  Ideal lines:       50–150 lines net
  Ideal complexity:  Single concern, single module

DECOMPOSE FURTHER WHEN:
  - Requires understanding > 2 distinct subsystems
  - Has internal sequential dependencies
  - Produces > 2 distinct artifact types
  - Estimated time > 30 min
  - Description exceeds 200 words

DO NOT DECOMPOSE WHEN:
  - Single function/method implementation
  - Single test file
  - Single config file change
  - < 50 lines across ≤ 2 files
```

### Task Definition Schema

```yaml
task_definition:
  task_id: "T{nn}"                       # within wave; globally: S{nn}_W{nn}_T{nn}
  wave_id: "string"
  stage_id: "string"
  type: "code | test | review | research | design | benchmark | config | release"

  specification:
    title: "string"                      # < 80 chars
    description: "string"               # 100–300 words
    acceptance_criteria:
      - criterion: "string"
        verification: "string"
    constraints: ["string"]

  scope:
    owned_files:
      create: ["string"]
      modify: ["string"]
      read_only: ["string"]

  dependencies:
    depends_on_tasks: ["string"]
    interface_contracts:
      - name: "string"
        direction: "produces | consumes"
        signature: "string"

  estimation:
    complexity: "L | M | H"
    estimated_minutes: "integer"         # 5–45
    agent_type: "research | design | implement | test | review"
    model_preference: "fast | default"

  timeout_seconds: "integer"
  max_retries: 1
```

### Task Description Template

```
WHAT: [1-2 sentences: what to produce/accomplish]
WHY:  [1 sentence: why this task exists in stage context]
INPUTS:
  - [artifact or file] from [source]: [brief description]
OUTPUTS:
  - [file path]: [what it contains]
CONSTRAINTS:
  - [constraint 1]
DONE WHEN:
  - [binary testable criterion 1]
  - [binary testable criterion 2]
```

## 5. Gate Quality Mechanism
From §5:

### Gate Types

| Type | Rounds | Checks | Use When |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| **standard** | 1 | build, test, lint, acceptance_criteria | Research, design, plan, release |
| **convergence** | 1–6 (default 3) | code_review, test, benchmark, SOLID, acceptance | Implementation stages |
| **passthrough** | 0 | none | Intermediate aggregation stages |

### Composite Score Formula
From §5.3:

#### Standard Composite (4 dimensions — backward compatible)

```
composite = Σ(dimension_score × weight)

Dimensions:
  test_quality       × 0.30   (tests_passed / tests_total × 100, or coverage_pct)
  code_review        × 0.30   (quality_score from review findings)
  architecture       × 0.20   (SOLID review score)
  benchmark          × 0.20   (benchmark pass_rate, or 100 if no benchmarks)
```

#### Extended Composite (7 dimensions — when user-facing verification is present)

When the product-verification pipeline is active, three additional dimensions are
added and weights are redistributed:

```
composite = test_quality       × 0.20
          + code_review        × 0.20
          + architecture       × 0.15
          + benchmark          × 0.15
          + visual_fidelity    × 0.10
          + interaction_quality × 0.10
          + acceptance_verification × 0.10
```

Selection logic: if any `user_facing_verification` scores are present in the gate
report, the extended formula applies. Otherwise the standard 4-dimension formula
is used. This ensures full backward compatibility.

### Per-Dimension Quality Score
From §5.3:

```
quality_score = max(0, 100 - Σ(severity_weight × finding_count))

Severity weights:
  blocker  = 25
  critical = 15
  major    = 5
  minor    = 1
  info     = 0
```

### User-Facing Verification Dimension Scores (v5.4.0)

Each user-facing dimension follows the same `quality_score` formula above, applied
to findings within that dimension's scope:

| Dimension | Input Source | Score Computation |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| **visual_fidelity** | Screenshot diff results, pixel mismatch counts | `max(0, 100 - Σ(severity_weight × finding_count))` where findings are classified by diff magnitude: >10% pixels = blocker, >5% = critical, >2% = major, >0.5% = minor |
| **interaction_quality** | E2E flow results, accessibility audit | `max(0, 100 - Σ(severity_weight × finding_count))` where findings come from failed user flows (blocker/critical) and accessibility violations (severity mapped from WCAG impact level) |
| **acceptance_verification** | Acceptance criteria test results | `max(0, 100 - Σ(severity_weight × finding_count))` where each unmet criterion is a blocker, partially met is critical, met-with-caveats is minor |

### Pass Conditions (ALL required)

1. `composite_score >= threshold` (default 85)
2. Zero blocker findings AND zero MUST-priority violations
3. `coverage >= coverage_threshold` (default 80%)
4. `round >= min_rounds` (default 1)

### On FAIL

- `round < max_rounds` → run another convergence round
- Score stagnant 2+ rounds → escalate
- `round >= max_rounds` → escalate to Project Agent → human

### Gate Profiles
From §5.4:

| Profile | Composite | Coverage | Blockers | Criticals | Min Rounds | Max Rounds | Visual | Interaction | Acceptance | Use When |
|---------|-----------|----------|----------|-----------|------------|------------|--------|-------------|------------|----------|
| **relaxed** | ≥ 70 | ≥ 60% | 0 | ≤ 5 | 1 | 2 | — | — | — | Prototypes, spikes, PoCs |
| **standard** | ≥ 85 | ≥ 80% | 0 | ≤ 2 | 1 | 3 | ≥ 70 | ≥ 70 | ≥ 80 | Default for most projects |
| **strict** | ≥ 90 | ≥ 85% | 0 | 0 | 2 | 4 | ≥ 85 | ≥ 85 | ≥ 90 | Production, public APIs |
| **audit** | ≥ 95 | ≥ 90% | 0 | 0 | 3 | 6 | ≥ 90 | ≥ 90 | ≥ 95 | Security audits, compliance |

Visual/Interaction/Acceptance thresholds apply only when the extended composite
(7-dimension) formula is active. A dash (—) means user-facing verification is
not enforced at that profile level.

### 5.5 Gate Primitive Composition (v8.0.0+)

The Gate Quality Mechanism is composed of 7 runtime primitives shipped
across the v8.x cycle. Each primitive is independently opt-in (R5
default-OFF) and verified by its own EvoBench scenario; the table below
maps each to its module, introduction version, default state per gate
profile, regression scenario, and opt-in env-flag. Theme T5 (v9.0.0
PV-06 default-on flip) requires this enumeration as a precondition.

| # | Module | Introduced | Default state per profile | EvoBench scenario | Opt-in env-flag |
|---|--------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | `gate/budget.py::TokenBudgetBreaker` | v8.0.0 P-03 | OFF on standard/relaxed; ESCALATE on strict/audit | `decomposition_feature` | `DEVOLAFLOW_TOKEN_BUDGET_BREAKER` |
| 2 | `gate/scorer.py::evaluate_ladder` | v8.0.0 P-05 | ON for decomposition profiles; 6 rungs R1..R6 short-circuit | `gate_ladder_score` | (default-on, no flag) |
| 3 | `gate/cycle_detector.py` | v8.0.0 P-06 | OFF (opt-in via `gate_cycle_detection`); exact_match / fuzzy_match ≥ 80% / edit_oscillation A→B→A→B | `cycle_detection_round_2` | `DEVOLAFLOW_CYCLE_DETECTOR` |
| 4 | `gate/ratchet.py` | v8.0.0 P-07 | OFF (opt-in via `gate_ratchet_enabled`); 4-verdict ADVANCE/TOLERATE/ROLLBACK/ESCALATE; deterministic oracle excludes review_findings per S/O/R-resistance | `ratchet_round_3` | `DEVOLAFLOW_GATE_RATCHET` |
| 5 | `gate/complexity_detector.py` | v8.0.0 P-09 | OFF (opt-in); nines analyze subprocess + MOCK fallback | `complexity_subprocess` | `DEVOLAFLOW_COMPLEXITY_DETECTOR` |
| 6 | `ac_generator.py` | v8.0.0 P-10 | OFF (opt-in; companion to legacy `accept` list); 11 deterministic patterns; 3-dim quality scoring | `ac_generator_density` | `DEVOLAFLOW_AC_GEN` |
| 7 | `legibility/scorer.py` | v8.2.0 PV-02 | OFF (opt-in via `decomposition.legibility_check`) | `legibility_score` | `DEVOLAFLOW_LEGIBILITY_CHECK` |

**Composition rule**: primitives compose multiplicatively at the gate
verdict level — a gate FAIL by ANY enabled primitive blocks advancement;
a gate PASS requires ALL enabled primitives to pass. The `evaluate_ladder`
primitive (#2) is the orchestrator that short-circuits via the 6-rung
ladder (R1 quality → R2 coverage → R3 blockers → R4 budget → R5 cycle →
R6 ratchet) — failures at lower rungs preempt evaluation of higher
rungs. Per W-4 / SI-4, any change to a primitive's module triggers the
EvoBench scenario for that primitive plus the composite scenarios that
exercise it (`decomposition_feature`, `gate_ladder_score`).

**v9.0.0 PV-06 flip plan** (forward-defined per Theme T5): primitives
1, 3, 4, 5, 7 are scheduled to flip to ON for decomposition-enabled
profiles when the post-flip composite EvoBench score (≥ 90 floor per
W-4) holds. Primitive 6 stays opt-in (legacy `accept` list remains the
canonical surface; `acceptance_criteria_v2` is the structured successor
per `schemas/lean-dispatch.yaml#layout_invariant.canonical_order` position 15).

## 6. Convergence Loop Detail
From §Appendix C (design_agent_hierarchy.md):

```
CONVERGENCE LOOP (per Stage)

Round N:
  Phase 1: CODE REVIEW        (Review Agent)
  Phase 2: FIX review findings (Implement Agent)
  Phase 3: TEST               (Test Agent)
  Phase 4: FIX test failures   (Implement Agent)
  Phase 5: BENCHMARK           (Test Agent)
  Phase 6: FIX benchmark       (Implement Agent)
  Phase 7: FINAL REVIEW        (Review Agent)
  Phase 8: FIX final findings  (Implement Agent)

Gate Decision:
  composite ≥ threshold AND round ≥ min AND 0 blockers → PASS
  composite < threshold AND round < max               → NEXT ROUND
  round ≥ max                                          → ESCALATE

Each phase dispatched as a Wave with 1 Task.
Stage Agent orchestrates — never executes phases.
```

### 6.1 Lifecycle hook chain on round-N+1 dispatch (v8.4.4 PV-04 / Soul S-10)

Every round-N+1 dispatch emitted by
`src/devolaflow/feedback.py::ProposalGenerator.generate_round_dispatch`
runs through the lifecycle hook chain
(`pre_dispatch` → `post_dispatch`) via
`devolaflow.lifecycle.run_hooks(event, payload, strict=False)` per
Soul Rule S-10 ("Prompt-Side Governance Contract Embedding"). The
chain fires on every return path — round-1 pass-through,
no-reinforcement, and reinforcement-applied — so verifier-injected
governance contracts (Soul-set version, rule-manifest URL,
reinforcement state) reach the L3 dispatch payload deterministically.

See `references/plan-mode-enforcement.md` §10 for the S-10 contract
detail and `tests/test_dispatch_emission_runs_hooks.py` for the
regression suite that pins the wiring.

## 7. Failure Handling Chain
From §7:

### Failure Classification

| Level | Scope | Categories | Default Action |
|-------|-------|------------|----------------|
| **Task failure** | Single task | transient, deterministic, specification, resource | retry / fix_and_retry / escalate |
| **Wave failure** | One+ tasks | partial, conflict, total | retry_failed / rollback_and_reassign / escalate |
| **Stage failure** | Gate FAIL after max | quality, functional, design | add_round / loop_back_impl / loop_back_design |
| **Project failure** | Multiple stages | recoverable, scope_change, terminal | human_fix / re_decompose / divergence_report |

### Failure Handling Flowchart

```
Task Failure
  │
  ├─ transient? ──► Retry (max 1) ──► Pass? ──► OK
  │                                    │
  │                                   Fail
  │                                    ▼
  ├─ deterministic? ──► Auto-fix possible? ──Yes──► Fix + retry

  ├─ quality? ──► round < max? ──Yes──► Another convergence round
  │                    │
  │                   No ──► Escalate to Project
  │
  ├─ functional? ──► Loop back to implementation
  │
  ├─ design? ──► Loop back to design
  ▼
Project Failure ──► Human decides:
  ├─ fix direction ──► Resume from specified stage
  ├─ re-scope ──► Re-decompose project
  └─ abort ──► Halt with divergence report
```

### Retry Limits

| Level | Max Retries | On Exhaustion |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Task | 1 (by Wave Agent) | Promote to wave failure |
| Wave | 1 (partial retry by Stage) | Promote to stage failure |
| Convergence rounds | 3 default (1–6 per profile) | Promote to project failure |
| Stage | 2 (by Project Agent) | Escalate to human |
| Project loop-back budget | 3 total across all stages | Halt with divergence report |
| Human escalations | 3 max | Suggest project re-scoping |

## 8. Inline Self-Review Mode (v7.2.0+)

For low-risk waves where a separate verifier subagent would over-engineer the
quality check, L2 may select `inline_self_review` mode (declared in SKILL.md
"Wave Coordination Modes"). The executing agent runs through a pre-defined
checklist in-process at the end of its turn — approximate cost ~30 seconds vs
~25 minutes for the gen_verify subagent dispatch (50× wallclock saving).

**Source:** Imported from superpowers v5.0.6 release notes (verbatim):
"Replaced subagent review loops with inline self-review checklists in
brainstorming and writing-plans skills, reducing review time from ~25 minutes
to ~30 seconds while maintaining comparable defect detection."

### When inline_self_review is SAFE

Apply only to stages where defects are structural/organisational and the
executing agent is well-positioned to detect them via a checklist:

| Stage Type      | Safety Rationale |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| `research`      | Defect = missing source / wrong claim; checklist = "every claim has a source URL" |
| `design`        | Defect = missing interface / inconsistent terminology; checklist = "interface contracts complete, ADR sections present" |
| `documentation` | Defect = stale info / broken link / unclear example; checklist = "links validated, terms defined, examples runnable" |

### When to KEEP gen_verify_mode (UNSAFE for inline)

| Stage Type       | Why subagent verifier is required |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `implement`      | Logic bugs require execution-style verification (run tests, lint) |
| `test`           | Gate validity depends on independent test reproduction |
| `refactor`       | Regression risk requires second-pair-of-eyes review |
| `security-audit` | Defect-cost is high; comparable detection NOT claimed |

### Activation

Opt-in per profile via `context_profiles.yaml`:
`inline_review_checklist: true` (default `false`). Mutually exclusive with
`decomposition.gen_verify_mode: true` — if both are set, gen_verify wins.
